					<p>Your blanket is first soaked in a warm water tub to loosen the dirt;
						then it is washed with a phosphate-free and scent-free soap for a
						1:45 hr cycle in a washing machine. Sodium bicarbonate is added to
						the wash to help remove that “horsey” smell. When your blanket is
						finished being washed, it is hung to dry. It usually takes between 12
						and 18 hours to fully dry the blanket.

			<h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>
			<p>You have invested a lot of money buying your horse blankets.
				Here are some tips on making that investment last longer:</p>
		</header>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="12u">
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Clean your blanket regularly</h3>
							<p>Your horse will roll, or lay down with the blanket on. The sand and dirt from the ground
								will get infused into the fabric of your blanket. That dirt can break down the weave of
								the fabric and weaken the integrity of the blanket – making it rip more easily.
								Alternatively
								over-washing can
								damage the waterproof material. If you suspect that your blanket is not as waterproof as
								it used
								to be there are marine-grade products that can be spayed to make it more water-proof but
								be
								sure to have it sprayed on a clean and dry blanket.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Don’t put wet/damp blankets in plastic bags</h3>
							<p>Wet fabric, especially if infused with manure and dirt will mold. Not only does mold eat
								away at
								the fabric but it is almost impossible to remove that mold without ruining the integrity
								of the
								blanket fabric.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>If there is a small rip get it fixed before it gets larger</h3>
							<p>Horses being what they are will manage to find the only nail sticking out on the paddock
								rail or
								their playful paddock mates want to play a game of bite the blanket. A small rip can
								quickly turn
								into a large rip, or worse, a piece of fabric flapping in the breeze and freaking out
								your horse.
								Getting those smaller rips repaired in a timely fashion can prevent damage too severe to
								repair.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Make Sure your blanket fits properly</h3>
							<p>Properly fitting your horse’s blanket is extremely important. In addition to making sure
								all your
								straps are fitted correctly, remember that all blanket manufacturers design their
								blankets a little
								differently. Some run big, some narrower, etc. An ill-fitted blanket will restrict your
								horse’s
								movement. If you buy a blanket that is too big it will constantly want to slide back and
								twist. An
								unhappy blanketed horse will soon find a way to remove that blanket – without your
								assistance.
								It is worth your time to find a blanket brand that has designed their blankets to more
								suitably fit
								your horse. Consider criss-crossing leg straps and having belly straps snug-not tight
								(one flat
								hand between the strap and the horse’s belly).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Timing is everything</h3>
							<p>I can’t tell you how many times clients have pulled out their blankets the
								day they need it only to realize that the blanket is dirty or in need of repair. A panic
								ensues as
								weather conditions make washing/repair a crisis. Consider reviewing the condition of
								your
								blanket at the end of the season and get it cleaned/repaired before putting it away.
								That way
								when you need that winter blanket the day before it turns wintery, it will be ready for
								whatever
								mother nature plans.</p>
						</li>
